This week we are starting Lesson 3, pertaining to Network Interface cards. 
"Token-ring" conneting your devices to NICs.. Using a shielded twisted pair. "Token-bus" - history of ethernet 
Getting rid of collissions by adding a switch.
Bridge is used to connect two or more network segments. A bridge is smart. It transmits data frames. It resides in the data link layer on the OSI model. 
Its main job is to filter, forward, or block data frames based on their MAC addresses. Essentially, a bridge enhances network efficiency by segmenting traffic and reducing collisions.
A bridge is smarter than a hub, but simpier than a router. (2-4 ports, same amount of ports as a repeater)
Router- A router connects different networks together, such as a home network to the internet, and manages traffic between them.
Ethernet frame- Preamble, recipient, sender MAC, Type, Data, Pad, FCS
~ preamble- A 64 bit information tellng the receiving NIC that a frame is coming and where the frame starts ~ SFD (start frane delimiter) Marks the end of the preamble and start of the frame.
~ Destination address (6 bytes)- Mac address of the intended recipient. 
~ Source Address - Mac address of the sender.
~ Type/length (2 bytes) - Specifies the type of payload or length of the data.
~ payload/data - The actual data being transmitted.
~ FCS (frame check sequence, 4 bytes ) Error-checking CRC (cyclic redundancy check).
