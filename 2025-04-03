electromagnetic spectrum, computers use energy. EM energy is in the form of electrical currents, radio waves, microwaves.
Also called the effective data.
Attenuation- loss of signal strength from one end of the cable to the other.
There are several issues: Signal strenth loss during transmission. Long cabaling distancing 
Solutions- Shorten cable length, use repeaters and extenders. Measure and test signal attentunation at installation. 
EMI- (Electromagnetic Interference) external signs that interfere with normal communications. " disruptions that affects electrical circuit"
Common sources - Generataters, motors, radio transmitters, welders.
Protection against EMI/RFI- USe fiber optic cables, use shielded twisted pair, avoid installing cables near EMI/RFI sources.
Crosstalk interference
