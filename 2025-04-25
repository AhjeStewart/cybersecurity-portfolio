Broadcast domains- Logical group of devices on the same data link network can reach eachother. There are several types of broadcasts.
Multiple broadcast domains..Two or more broadcast domains, typically they are seperated by a layer 3 device (routers 
Number of broadcast domains increases. Number collision stays the same... Each swithc port is its own collision domain.
V-lan (virtual private network)- is a logical subdivision of a physical network that groups together a collection of devices—even if those devices aren’t physically on the same segment—into a separate broadcast domain at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. 
This abstraction allows network administrators to flexibly organize networks based on function, role, or security requirements rather than just physical location.
Subnet vs VLANS- Subnets and VLANs are both methods for segmenting networks, but they operate at different layers of the OSI model and serve distinct purposes.
Communictions between VLANS require a router. 
Static VLAN vs Dynamic- Static VLANs are configured manually by network administrators, with each switch port permanently assigned to a specific VLAN. Once assigned, any device that plugs into that port becomes part of the designated VLAN.
Dynamic VLAN- Dynamic VLANs automate the assignment process by using protocols and policies to determine the appropriate VLAN for a device or user. Rather than being tied to a physical port, the VLAN membership is determined at the time of authentication.
